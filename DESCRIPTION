Description: The UNHCR Refugee Population Statistics Database
    contains information about forcibly displaced populations
    spanning more than 70 years of statistical activities.
    It covers displaced populations such as refugees, asylum-seekers and
    internally displaced people, including their demographics.
    Stateless people are also included, most of who have never been displaced.
    The database also reflects the different types of solutions
    for displaced populations such as repatriation or resettlement.
