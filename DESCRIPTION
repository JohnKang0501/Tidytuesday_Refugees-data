Description: The UNHCR Refugee Population Statistics Database 
    contains information about forcibly displaced populations 
    spanning more than 70 years of statistical activities. 
    It covers displaced populations such as refugees, asylum-seekers and 
    internally displaced people, including their demographics. 
    Stateless people are also included, most of who have never been displaced. 
    The database also reflects the different types of solutions 
    for displaced populations such as repatriation or resettlement.
