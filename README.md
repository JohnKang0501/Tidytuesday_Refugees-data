UNHCRâ€™s [Refugee Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/) contains information about forcibly displaced populations spanning across almost 70 years of statistical activities. It covers displaced populations such as refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced persons, including their demographics. Stateless persons are also included, most of who have never been displaced. The database also reflects the different types of solutions for displaced populations such as repatriation or resettlement. The data is available on the refugee statistics website and in the associated mobile app.

Details relating to data collation, storage, and definitions are available on the [methodology](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/methodology/) section of the website.
